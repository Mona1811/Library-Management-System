üìö Library Management System 


Project Explanation


Project Overview

The Library Management System is a Java console application designed to simulate the operations of a real-world library.
It provides a practical environment for learners to apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Composition.

This system allows library users to add, search, borrow, and return books, while maintaining accurate records of book availability. It demonstrates how real-life entities like Books and Users can be modeled using classes and objects, and how these interact to perform complex operations efficiently.

Project Objectives

Develop a mini-library management system that can handle book and user operations.

Apply OOP concepts in Java to model real-world entities.

Create a menu-driven console interface for interactive user experience.

Ensure the system is scalable and extendable, allowing future enhancements like role-based access or GUI integration.

Key Features & Functionalities

Book Management: Add new books, display all books, search by title.

User Management: Maintain user information and extendable for roles like Student or Librarian.

Borrow and Return Functionality: Issue and return books while tracking availability.

Menu-Driven Interface: Users interact through a simple console menu and can perform multiple operations continuously.

Error Handling: Gracefully handles invalid operations like borrowing unavailable books or searching for non-existent books.

How the System Works Internally

Book Class: Stores book details (ID, title, author, availability) and methods to borrow, return, and display book information.

User Class: Stores user details (ID, name) and can be extended to specialized roles.

Library Class: Manages a collection of Book objects and handles adding, searching, issuing, and returning books.

Main Class: Provides the interactive console menu and processes user input using loops and switch-case logic.

OOP Concepts Applied

Encapsulation: Private fields with getters/setters for controlled access.

Inheritance: User class can be extended to Student and Librarian.

Polymorphism: Borrowing/returning rules can vary by user type.

Composition: Library ‚Äúhas-a‚Äù list of Book objects.

Learning Outcomes

Gain hands-on experience in Java programming with OOP.

Learn to design multi-class applications and structure code for real-world scenarios.

Understand role-based behavior and data encapsulation.

Practice interactive menu-driven programming and modular code design.

Learn error handling for invalid operations.

Why this Project is Important

Demonstrates practical application of OOP principles in Java.

Provides a foundation for advanced projects such as GUI or database-integrated library systems.

Develops skills in problem-solving, modular design, and real-world system modeling.

Conclusion

The Library Management System is a functional, well-structured project that models real-world library operations while reinforcing core OOP principles.
It provides a solid learning experience and can be extended for more complex systems in the future.
